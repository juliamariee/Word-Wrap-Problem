Our project group has done this assignment completely on our own. We have not copied it, nor have we given
our solution to anyone else. We understand that if we are involved in plagiarism we will have to sign an official
form stating that we have cheated, and this form will be stored in our student records. We also understand that
we will receive a grade of 0 for this project.
